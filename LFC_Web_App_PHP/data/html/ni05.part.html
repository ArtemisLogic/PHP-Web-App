<p>The 19-year-old has not signed a new deal offered by the Championship side, a situation which has seen the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham, Celtic and Juventus all circling for his services.</p>
<p>The Mirror report that Juventus fancy their chances of persuading the young midfielder into a move to Serie A, but the British sides remain keen on him.</p>
<p>The Baggies want to keep hold of one of their brightest talents and new boss Slaven Bilic is trying to persuade him to sign a new contract at the Hawthorns, and will be willing to make him a key part of the team going forward.</p>
<p>Former West Brom boss James Shan described Harper: "Rak is a powerful young boy, very good in the half-turn and he can play forward.
"He is probably more of an offensive midfield player than one that will sit in and screen and deny."</p>
<p>The midfielder made his West Brom debut in the Premier League in August 2017, before going out on loan to Blackburn Rovers in League One.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old made 16 Championship appearances for the Baggies last season and 22 in all competitions.</p>
