Liverpool are not interested in signing Real Betis defender Junior Firpo this summer.

<div class="n-main">

<p>Reports in Spain over the weekend claimed the European champions were ready to trigger a 50million euro buyout clause to land the versatile Firpo.</p>

<p>Madrid newspaper Marca suggested the Reds were not put off by the fee required to sign Firpo as Jurgen Klopp chases down cover and competition for current left-back Andy Robertson. </p>

<p>Manchester United are also reportedly interested, with the two Premier League giants set to fight it out to land Betis' 22-year-old left-back, according to the Spanish publication.</p>

<p>With Alberto Moreno set to leave Anfield this month, the Reds have something of a pressing concern on the left side of their defence with Robertson the only senior member of the squad who specialises in the role.</p>

<p>James Milner played there for virtually the entirety of the 2016-17 season, but the 33-year-old was returned to his favoured midfield role when Robertson was brought to Anfield two years ago.</p>

<p>Despite a lack of depth at left-back, however, claims that Firpo will become the first signing of the summer at Anfield are inaccurate.
The ECHO understands the Santo Domingo-born Firpo is not on the Reds' radar and has not been discussed by manager Klopp or sporting director Michael Edwards.</p>

<p>Liverpool won't be paying a €50m buyout clause for a player who would come into the fold as back-up to the influential Robertson.
Unlike the events of last year when Liverpool paid out around £170m to sign Xherdan Shaqiri, Alisson Becker, Naby Keita and Fabinho, the Reds are set for a much more subdued summer.</p>

<p>A left-back is likely to be on the agenda before the close of the window on August 8, but a big-money move for Firpo won't come to fruition. The Spanish U21 international was asked about his future over the weekend, with Real Madrid reportedly also interested.</p>

<p>"Did Madrid call me? If you want to know, you can ask them," Firpo was quoted as saying. "I’m here with the national team and that’s all I want to think about.</p>

<p>"I have said that Real Madrid was more attractive to me because my father is from Madrid. This has nothing to do with where I would rather play.</p>

<p>"Honestly, the team that is most interesting to me right now is Real Betis, where I have been since I was young."</p>

<p>Liverpool are set for a more conservative spending spree this window with Klopp happy to merely tweak a squad that finished as Premier League runners-up with 97 points and Champions League winners.</p>

<p>Daniel Sturridge's exit has perhaps increased the need for another addition to the forward areas while Moreno will need replacing, but blockbuster deals are not expected to be forthcoming.</p>


<p>Liverpool spent close to £250m across two transfer windows in 2018 to bulk up Klopp's squad with top-class talent and enable the club to challenge for honours long term.</p>
<p>As such, Klopp is relaxed about the prospect of adding to his ranks as the Reds get set for another big season.</p>
