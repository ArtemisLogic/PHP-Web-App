<h3>Jurgen Klopp wants transfer for 'next Xabi Alonso'</h3>
<p>Jurgen Klopp is ready to make a move for the 'next Xabi Alonso at Liverpool', according to reports from Spain.
</p>
<p>
The Reds boss has signed just one player so far this summer - Sepp van den Berg for £1.3million - but has hinted he could open the chequebook before the window slams shut.
</p>
<p>
One man who has been linked with a move to Liverpool this summer is Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos.
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old isn't guaranteed first team football at the Bernabeu this season, and a number of Premier League clubs including Arsenal and Tottenham are also taking a look at the Spaniard.
</p>
<p>
Klopp is believed to be interested in signing the Real Betis graduate.
</p>
<p>
But according to Marca, via SportWitness, who have claimed the Spaniard can become the 'next Xabi Alonso' at Anfield, there is a problem that could derail the deal.

<p>The paper reports that Klopp is only interested in the transfer if the Reds can buy the midfielder outright.
</p>
<p>
The German doesn't want a buy-back clause included in the deal. Real Madrid however do as they feel Ceballos could one day lead their midfield.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Ceballos reportedly shares this view and would only agree to a Liverpool transfer if such a clause was put in place.
