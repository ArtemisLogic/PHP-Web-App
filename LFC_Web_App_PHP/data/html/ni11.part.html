<h3>Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham chasing Dani Ceballos</h3>
<p>
Real Madrid are ready to let Dani Ceballos leave the club with Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool all reportedly interested in the talented youngster.
</p>
<p>
Ceballos is coming off the back of a victorious tournament with Spain at the European Under-21 Championship but the midfielder is reportedly not in Zinedine Zidane’s plans at Real Madrid next season.
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old’s situation at the Bernabeu is being monitored by several big clubs across Europe, but according to Spanish publication Marca, it is the Premier League clubs of Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool who are top of list in competing for his signature.
</p>
<p>
The report suggests Tottenham are in pole position to sign the player.
</p>
<p>
Ceballos could even become part of a deal for Christian Eriksen, who only has one year left on his contract and is showing no interest in renewing his contract with Spurs.
</p>
<p>
Tottenham are looking to sell the Dane this summer rather than risk losing him for nothing next year, with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy reportedly reducing the club’s asking price for Eriksen from £134m to £62m.
</p>
<p>
When asked about his plans for next season Ceballos, who scored three goals for Real in 13 La Liga starts in their last campaign, insisted he is prioritising playing time and being at a team where he is wanted.
</p>
<p>
“The most important thing in this life is to be happy and it is something that can only be achieved by playing 40 games a year,” he told Marca.
</p>
<p>
“My personal goal for next season is to play 40 games, to get comfortable with myself at all times.
</p>
<p>
“Wherever it is, but in a place where I can feel valued.”
</p>
<p>
Ceballos is also wanted by Arsenal, who are reportedly trying the hardest of all the current clubs involved to sign the midfielder.
</p>
<p>
However, as Gunners boss Unai Emery is looking at strengthening several areas of his squad on a limited transfer budget of £45m, the report suggests the club favour a loan deal with an option to buy Ceballos at a later date.
</p>
<p>
It is not known whether this option would be acceptable to Real as Zidane is still looking to raise money to fund more transfers as he puts the finishing touches on his new-look side for next season.
</p>
<p>
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is also interested Ceballos but given the competition for places in the Champions League winners' squad the German might struggle to offer the Spaniard the minutes he is demanding.
</p>
<p>
One issue to any possible transfer could be Real’s preference to include a buy-back option in any deal, but the interested teams will no doubt be boosted by Ceballos' recent comments.
</p>
<p>
Upon returning from winning the under-21 Euros he insisted he had “no specific” league in mind for his next move but isn’t worried about leaving Spain.
</p>
<p>
“What I know is that I want to enjoy next year and I am open to try new experiences, I am not afraid,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I know that next year I have a very nice challenge ahead.
</p>
<p>
“I would like to try new things and, above all, enjoy a lot.”
