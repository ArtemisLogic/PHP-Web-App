<h3>
Liverpool enter race for Real Madrid midfielder
</h3>
<p>
Liverpool have reportedly entered the race to sign Real Madrid starlet Dani Ceballos.
</p>
<p>
Ceballos has caught the eye at the U21s European Championships this summer but he has no future under Zinedine Zidane at the Bernabeu.
</p>
<p>
Arsenal and Tottenham are both believed to be keeping tabs on the 22-year-old, with AC Milan also in the mix and Real not ruling out a loan move.
</p>
<p>
But reports in Spain suggest Liverpool are also keen on Ceballos.
</p>
<p>
Marca claims Liverpool have been keeping an eye on the midfielder with their interest growing in recent weeks.
</p>
<p>
While Jürgen Klopp was not expected to do much business this summer, it is suggested he believes Ceballos would add an extra dimension to the Liverpool midfield.
