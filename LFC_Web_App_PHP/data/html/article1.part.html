		Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following 
		year and has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established 
		itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 
		1980s when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the 
		club to a combined eleven League titles, four European Cups, two UEFA Cups, 
		seven domestic cups and several super cups within a span of eighteen seasons.

		Under the management of Rafael Benítez and captained by homegrown star Steven Gerrard, 
		Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in 2005 before adding a sixth crown 
		under Jürgen Klopp in 2019.

		Liverpool was the ninth highest-earning football club in the world in 2016–17, with an 
		annual revenue of €424.2 million,[3]and the world's eighth most valuable football club in 2018, 
		valued at $1.944 billion.[4] The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. 
		Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton.

		The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the Heysel Stadium disaster, 
		where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in 
		Brussels, with 39 people – mostly Italians and Juventus fans – dying, after which English clubs 
		were given a five-year ban from European competition, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, 
		where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing.
	</p>
	<p>
		The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which 
		has been used ever since. Red has been the main shirt colour ever since 1896.[6] The club's 
		anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".
