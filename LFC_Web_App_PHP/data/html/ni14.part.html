<h3>Real Madrid star set to sign for Reds</h3>
<p>
Real Madrid star Dani Ceballos is set to sign for Liverpool this summer, according to huge reports from Spain.
</p>
<p>
Real Madrid star Ceballos was linked with Liverpool during the January transfer window.
</p>
<p>
However, the Spaniard ultimately stayed at the Bernabeu, where he has struggled for game time so far.
</p>
<p>
Ceballos joined Real Madrid from Real Betis in the summer but Spanish outlet Don Balon claim a move to Liverpool is now in the offing.
</p>
<p>
The Reds are expected to spend shrewdly this summer despite currently soaring under Jurgen Klopp.
</p>
<p>
And Liverpool are also likely to spend big with the Merseyside giants yet to replace Philippe Coutinho, who left for Barcelona in January.
</p>
<p>
Don Balon go into detail on Liverpool’s interest in the player.
</p>
<p>
It is said Klopp will ‘spare no expense’ as he aims to bring the player to the club.
</p>
<p>
Real president Florentino Perez will supposedly rubber-stamp a transfer at the end of the season.
</p>
<p>
But, in order to make sure he does not miss out on the player’s potential, he will include a buy-back clause.
</p>
<p>
Ceballos is now expected to be Liverpool’s first signing of the summer.
</p>
<p>
<p>Yet Klopp is unlikely to stop there.
</p>
<p>
A goalkeeper is also on their radar with Roma shotstopper Alisson Becker their No 1 target.
</p>
<p>
And Liverpool have also been linked with the likes of Thomas Lemar and Paulo Dybala.
