<p>
Toby Alderweireld's last-gasp own goal gave Liverpool a huge 2-1 victory over Tottenham as they returned to the top of the Premier League on Super Sunday.
</p>
<h2>As it happened</h2>
<h3>Liverpool vs Spurs: Player ratings</h3>
<p>
The Spurs defender nudged the ball over the line after Hugo Lloris had parried Mo Salah's header into his path (90), meaning that with six games remaining Liverpool lead Manchester City by two points, though Pep Guardiola's side do have a game in hand.
</p>
<p>
Liverpool took the lead through Roberto Firmino's glancing header (16) from Andrew Robertson's superb delivery, but Spurs levelled controversially with 20 minutes left through Lucas Moura's tap in, though replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball was in motion from Harry Kane's free-kick to start the move.
</p>
<p>
Spurs should have scored a second late on as Moussa Sissoko blazed over having found himself through, before Anfield went wild with the sloppy yet hugely vital winner on 90 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Spurs' five-man defence allowed both Liverpool full-backs too much space in the first half, and the hosts' opener came from Robertson's delightful left-wing cross, pinpoint for Firmino's head as he glanced past Lloris unmarked from eight yards.
</p>
<p>
But the nerves were still apparent among Liverpool's players in a first-half littered in loose passes, with Dele Alli striking just over on the half volley from 25 yards to give the hosts a scare.
</p>
<p>
Sadio Mane went within inches of doubling Liverpool's lead at the other end, curling just wide from 20 yards, before Spurs looked to rectify their issues by moving to a back four after the break with Danny Rose pushed into left midfield.
</p>
<p>
Spurs had their first clear opening after the break as Alisson parried Kane's effort into the path of Christian Eriksen, but the midfielder's follow-up shot was brilliantly blocked by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
</p>
<h3>Salah hits back</h3>
<p>After playing a part in Liverpool's dramatic late victory, Mohamed Salah hit back at his critics who say he's having a bad season.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher after the game, Salah said: "I didn't score for a couple of games but there are some players who has the same number of goals as me but people are saying those players are having the best season of their life.</p>
