<p>
	Rumours have been spreading from the son of Maurizio Sarri via Twitter stating that the Italian manager has his eyes set on 
	Mohamed Salah next season.
</p>
<p>
	Although Liverpool's manager Klopp has commented they will not be outbid in the coming season, there are suspicions that 
	this rumour is just to troll the 52 year old German and there have been no official reports confirming or denying that this 
	rumour has any validity.
</p>

<p>
	Liverpool and Juventus are also interested in signing David Seaman out of retirement, and if Seaman accepts, there is
	expected to be a bidding war between him also.
