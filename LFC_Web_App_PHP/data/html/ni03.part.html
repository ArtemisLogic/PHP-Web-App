Manchester United and Liverpool are set to compete over the signing of Real Betis left-back Junior Firpo, according to Marca.

<div class="n-main">

<p>The 22-year-old has broken through at the La Liga side over the past 18-months and caught the eye this season, scoring three goals and providing four assists in 24 league games.</p>

<p>Betis face a fight to hold onto the Dominican Republic-born Spain U21 international, though, as he has a €50m release clause in his contract that both United and Liverpool could trigger.</p>
<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is on the lookout for young players this summer with 21-year-old Daniel James joining from Swansea and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, also 21, expected to move from Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile, is in the market for a left-back after allowing Alberto Moreno to leave Liverpool at the end of his contract and Firpo’s attacking instincts would fit well with his team’s philosophy.
Andrew Robertson is nailed on as Liverpool’s starting left-back after supplying an impressive 11 assists in the Premier League last season, but Klopp is eager to sign someone to challenge the Scotland captain for his place.</p>

<p>Firpo, who was linked with Real Madrid prior to their signing of Ferland Mendy from Lyon, has amassed 43 appearances for Betis since making his debut in February 2018.</p>
