	John Jones and Gary Smith, a gay couple from Russia were celebrating Liverpool's win from the roof of an 
	abandoned warehouse as the team won the league. The party however took a dangerous turn as John 
	slipped off the edge of a building while intoxicated.Luckily enough he still had the balance to 
	catch himself on the ledge of the rooftop where his distraught partner rushed to help him back up.
</p>
<p>
 	There was a lot of confusion on the ground as onlookers didn't know what they were seeing and 
 	emergency services were called. Luckily no one was hurt, but in an interview afterwards John said
 	to Tired Eye News "I have a newfound appreciation for the value of life, and will never climb upon
 	a rooftop hereafter, this experience has gave me an existential epiphany and I will no longer be 
 	burdened by earthly worries, as I am alive and that's all that matters."
</p>
<p>
	Gary, his partner also commented that since the event he has had nightmares and believes it will take
	some time for the trauma to dissipate.
