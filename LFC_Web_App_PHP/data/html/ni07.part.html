Liverpool are not pursuing a transfer deal for Barcelona star Philippe Coutinho - but Manchester United, Chelsea and PSG ARE.

<div class="n-main">
<p>Liverpool sold Coutinho to Barcelona in January 2018, pocketing a huge £142million from the sale and using it to strengthen the squad.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to now, however, and the Brazil international may leave the La Liga giants having struggled for form and consistency throughout his time in Catalonia so far.</p>
<p>Liverpool were recently backed to lure Coutinho away from Barcelona this summer, with Jurgen Klopp supposedly ready to snap him up.</p>
<p>However, Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo say that the Samba star is not on the Reds’ radar for the summer.</p>
