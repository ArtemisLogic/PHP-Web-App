Junior Firpo remained coy when asked about rumours linking him with a move to Liverpool this summer.

</div>
<div class="n-main">
<p>The Real Betis full-back, who can play in several positions across defence and midfield, is suggested as a potential replacement for the outgoing Alberto Moreno.</p>
<p>Firpo is currently in action for Spain in the under-21 European Championships in Italy but remained tight-lipped when asked about rumours suggesting both Liverpool and Real Madrid were interested in his services.</p>
<p>"Did Madrid call me? If you want to know, you can ask them," the 22-year-old told El Larguero.</p>
<p>"I'm here with the national team and that's all I want to think about."
When asked about who he prefers out of Real and Barcelona by Marca earlier this month, Firpo added: "I have said that Real Madrid was more attractive to me because my father is from Madrid.</p>
<p>"This has nothing to do with where I would rather play.
"Honestly, the team that is most interesting to me right now is Real Betis, where I have been since I was young."</p>
