<h3>2015-2017: Two final losses, return to the UEFA Champions League</h3>

<p>On 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool 
	manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers. In his first press conference, Klopp 
	described his new side saying "it is not a normal club, it is a special 
	club. I had two very special clubs with Mainz and Dortmund. It is the 
	perfect next step for me to be here and try and help" and stating his 
	intention to deliver trophies within four years. During his first 
	conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' in a parody of Jose 
	Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004.
</p>
<p>Klopp's debut was a 0-0 away draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 17 October 2015. 
	On 28 October 2015, Klopp secured his first win as Liverpool manager against 
	Bournemouth in the League Cup to proceed to the quarter-finals. His first 
	Premier League win came three days later, a 3-1 away victory against Chelsea. 
	After three 1-1 draws in the opening matches of the UEFA Europa League, 
	Liverpool defeated Rubin Kazan 1-0 in Klopp's first win in Europe as a 
	Liverpool manager. On 6 February 2016, he missed a league match to have an 
	appendectomy after suffering suspected appendicitis. On 28 February 2016, 
	Liverpool lost the 2016 League Cup Final at Wembley to Manchester City on 
	penalties. Liverpool finished the 2015-16 season in eighth place.</p>

<h3>2017-present: Consecutive UEFA Champions League finals</h3>

<p>Klopp's side finished fourth in the 2017-18 Premier League, securing 
	qualification for the Champions League for a second consecutive season. 
	Klopp guided Liverpool to their first UEFA Champions League Final since 
	2007 in 2018 after a 5-1 aggregate quarter-final win against the eventual 
	Premier League champions, Manchester City and 7-6 aggregate win over Roma 
	in the semi-final. However, Liverpool went on to lose in the final 3-1 to 
	Real Madrid. This was Klopp's sixth defeat in seven major finals. Despite 
	their attacking prowess, Klopp's side had been criticised for their 
	relatively high number of goals conceded, something which Klopp sought to 
	improve by signing defender Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window, 
	for a reported fee of 75 million pounds, a world record transfer fee for a 
	defender.</p>
	
<p>On 2 December 2018, Klopp was charged with misconduct after running onto 
	the pitch during the Merseyside Derby to celebrate Divock Origi's 96th minute 
	winning goal with goalkeeper Alisson Becker. Following a 2-0 win against 
	Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves), Liverpool ended Boxing Day with a lead of 
	six points, only the fourth Premier League team to be unbeaten at this stage. 
	It was Klopp's 100th win as Liverpool manager in 181 matches. Klopp's defensive 
	additions proved to be effective. Klopp led Liverpool to consecutive UEFA 
	Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, winning the latter against Tottenham 
	Hotspur. On 29 December 2018, Klopp's side thrashed Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield, 
	extending their unbeaten home run in the league to 31 matches, matching their 
	unbeaten home run in the competition. The result saw them move nine points 
	clear at the top of the league, and meant Liverpool won all 8 of their matches 
	played in December. Klopp subsequently received the Premier League Manager 
	of the Month award for December 2018. Klopp's side finished the season as 
	runners-up to Manchester City, to whom they suffered their only league defeat 
	of the season. </p>
	
<p>In the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League, Klopp's side finished second in their 
	group. Klopp's side beat German champions Bayern Munich 3-1 in round 16 and 
	saw Liverpool qualify for the quarter-finals. Liverpool won their quarter-
	final tie against Porto and In the semi-finals beat Barcelona in what was 
	described as one of the greatest comebacks in Champions League history. In 
	the final at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium in Madrid against Tottenham 
	Hotspur, Liverpool won 2-0 with goals from Mohamed Salah and Origi, giving 
	Klopp his first trophy with Liverpool, his first Champions League title, and 
	the club's sixth European Cup/Champions League title overall.</p>
