<h3>
Liverpool 'close to agreeing deal for Dani Ceballos'</h3>
<p>
Fresh reports have linked Liverpool with emerging Real Madrid talent Dani Cellabos.
</p>
<p>
After a breakthrough season on loan at Real Betis, the 21-year-old has struggling for game time at the Bernabeu this term.
</p>
<p>
Spain U21 international Ceballos has been told that he can leave the Real this summer after failing to nail down a regular spot.
</p>
<p>
He has started just two games and netted twice for Zinedine Zidane's men, but Italian source Calciomercato report that decisive action from Jurgen Klopp has prized him away from AC Milan.
</p>
<p>
The attacking midfielder cost €18million when he prized away from Betis last term - but Los Blancos want around €40 million for him now.
</p>
<p>
That prices out long-time suitors Juventus, but not Liverpool, who need to add quality to their squad for a assault on the Premier League.
</p>
<p>
And their swift action may well have tied up the deal.
