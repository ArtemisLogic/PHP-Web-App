Liverpool have ‘interfered’ with Manchester United’s pursuit of Bruno Fernandes as Jürgen Klopp eyes his first summer signing.
</div>
<div class="n-main">
<p>That is according to Italian journalist Pietro Balzano Prota, who has been covering the transfer saga.</p>
<p>Fernandes scored 31 goals from midfield for Sporting Lisbon last season – a European record eclipsing Frank Lampard’s tally of 27 in 2009-10.</p>
<p>The Portuguese playmaker has four years left on his deal and is valued at £62.2million (€70m) by Sporting.</p>
<p>Manchester United have been described as ‘frontrunners’ for the 24-year-old but have faced stiff competition from Tottenham and Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>Liverpool were understood to have retracted their interest but fresh reports claim Anfield chiefs are eyeing up Fernandes once more.</p>
<>Prota, who has been covering the storied pursuit of the player for Radio Rossonera, revealed on Sunday evening that Liverpool could usurp United to Fernandes.</p>
<p>“Two teams are now contesting for #BrunoFernandes,” the journalist tweeted.</p>
<p>“#ManUtd were really close to sealing the deal but now #Liverpool have interfered the negotiations.</p>
<p>“The player has been dreaming about the PL since childhood. Who will be the winner?”</p>
