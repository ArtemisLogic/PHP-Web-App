	As Liverpool won the Champions League, the squad were all pictured to have been 
	drinking Monster energy drink in celebration.
</p>
<p>
	As a result sales of the soft drink have spiked all over the North West
	and people have even been reported to camp outside supermarkets as the supply dwindles.

	waiting to get his Monster fix.
